# Building Scalable AI Decision Systems in Python
## Balancing Automation and Human Review in Checkout-Free Retail

Note: Title slide (30 sec)

---

## What is Checkout-Free Retail?

- Shop, take products, and leave - no scanning, no lines
- System automatically detects and charges customers
- Critical balance between accuracy and customer experience
- Low-margin business requiring cost-effective solutions

Note: Introduction slide (1 min)

## The Four Critical Questions

- **WHO**: Which customer took the product?
- **WHAT**: Which product was taken?
- **WHERE**: From which shelf/location?
- **WHEN**: At what time did the action occur?

Note: Core problem definition (1 min)

---

## Multiple Decision Systems

- **Person Tracking**: Following customers throughout the store
- **Product Recognition**: Identifying items in varying conditions
- **Action Recognition**: Detecting take vs. return actions
- **Cart Verification**: Reconciling data to generate accurate receipts

Note: Technical components (1 min)

## The Human-in-the-Loop Dilemma

- **Human review**: Accurate but expensive and unscalable
- **Full automation**: Risky for customer experience
- **Business reality**: Retail operates on thin margins
- **Ideal solution**: Intelligent balance between automation and human review

Note: Core business challenge (1 min)

---

## Configuration Management

![Configuration Management]
(PLACEHOLDER: Diagram showing configuration flow)

- **Store-specific configurations**: Thresholds vary by location
- **Hot-reloading**: Update without service interruption
- **Centralized management**: Single source of truth
- **Version control**: Tracking configuration changes

Note: Configuration system (2 min) - discuss how configurations are managed at scale

---

## Decision Flow

1. **Request reception**: Task enters the system
2. **Worker assignment**: Based on task type and store
3. **Model application**: With store-specific thresholds
4. **Confidence evaluation**: Automated or human review?
5. **Result storage**: For auditing and future training
6. **Feedback loop**: Continuous improvement

Note: End-to-end flow explanation (2 min) - walk through a typical decision process
